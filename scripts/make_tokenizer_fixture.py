"""Regenerate the tokenizer parity fixture from the real BertTokenizer.

`WordPieceTokenizer.swift` is a port of `tokenization_bert.py`, and the corpus
vectors were produced by the original.  A word split differently sends the query
elsewhere in the embedding space and returns fluent, ranked, wrong passages —
silently.  `TokenizerParityTests` pins the two together, and this writes what it
pins them to.

Run it when the embedder changes, and only then; the output is checked in.
It needs `transformers`, which nothing else here uses, so run it from any
virtualenv that has it (gutenberg_kg's works):

    python3 -m pip install transformers
    python3 scripts/make_tokenizer_fixture.py

Writes `vocab.txt` — byte-identical to what `export_embedder` ships beside the
model — and `tokenizer_fixture.json` into the Swift test fixtures directory.
