// The cross-pack merge: what happens when the books and the diaries are
// folded into one ranking.
//
// Step 1 of analysis/CROSS_PACK_FUSION_PLAN.md. Until this file the merge had
// no test of any kind -- golden.json records one pack at a time, so the whole
// `corpus=all` path shipped ungated, which is how a strict round-robin between
// two lists of very different quality went unnoticed.
//
// These tests characterise what the merge does *today*, deliberately including
// the behaviour the plan intends to change. They are the before half of that
// comparison, not an endorsement: `strictlyAlternates` is the defect, written
// down so the fix has to come here and say so.
