# Knowledge Press Forest

Web port of the GutenbergKG forest: 253 public-domain books grown as trees
(space colonization + pipe model + genre tropism), laid out on a Fibonacci
annulus of genre groves. You drive a lantern cart through them.

This directory is additive — it does not replace the PyVista / Qt viewer.

See **[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)** for the backlog. Next: a real sky with
stars and weather.


## Run it

From this folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints. Click **Start driving**.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **W / S** | throttle / reverse |
| **A / D** or **Left / Right** | steer left / right (chase camera) |
| **Up / Down** | tilt the camera up / down (gamepad: right stick) |
| **Space** | brake |
| **C** | camera: behind the cart, high view, in the cart |
| **E** | read the nearest tree into the press |
| **G** | grove atlas — jump to a genre or an exhibit |
| **B** | every book — filter the corpus and jump to any tree |
| **Q** | ride the ring road (steer to hop off) |
| **H** | return home, in front of the corpus redwood |
| **L** | open the press (collected books) |
| **Esc** | settings (leaf complexity, geometry readout, camera, pace) |

Tap a grove's signpost, or its dot on the minimap, to list that grove's books;
jump to any one of them, or to the grove itself. The cart is **not** locked to rails
unless you ride the ring. A brick ring road links every grove in one loop
that never crosses itself, and a few spokes, spread round the hub, join it.
Where the ring doubles back at a far grove, the stop is a paved turning circle.

**Q** rides the ring: the cart follows the road itself (down a spoke first if
that is nearer), slowing for the bends, and lanterns light the next 50 m of
road. Steer, brake, or reverse to hop off.

The drive starts at home, facing the **corpus redwood** at the hub: one tree
for the whole library, 3.4 m tall per doubling of the corpus's chunks, with one
limb per book reaching toward that book's own tree. Its plaque and the **B**
list lead to every book. **Exhibits** stand in roadside glades; the first is
Kepler's *Mysterium Cosmographicum*. Gold diamonds on the minimap jump to them.

Trees in a grove are placed as tight as their wood allows: each takes the
innermost spot where its trunk keeps 7.5 m and every branch keeps 0.6 m of air
from its neighbours, so crowns interleave but never pass through each other.

**Silent mode** (the bell, or Esc settings) stops cards popping up on their
own: nearby books, the redwood, quest hints. **E** still reads a tree.

On a phone, use the on-screen stick. Type a word in the lantern field to
light matching groves (`stoic`, `freedom`, `fire`, `sea`) — the lantern trail
points at the nearest hit. Switch season to **Winter** to drop the canopy and
read the wood.

## Map to the PyVista stack

| gutenberg_kg | this package |
| --- | --- |
| `src/gutenberg_kg/treegeom.py` — space colonization, pipe model, tropism | [`src/game/growTree.ts`](src/game/growTree.ts) |
| `ForestLayout` — Fibonacci annulus, genre groves | [`src/game/forest.ts`](src/game/forest.ts) |
| seasons / foliage | [`src/game/seasons.ts`](src/game/seasons.ts) |
| book corpus | [`src/game/catalog.ts`](src/game/catalog.ts) |
| `viz3d.py` Qt/PyVista viewer | [`src/game/ForestCanvas.tsx`](src/game/ForestCanvas.tsx) + [`Player.tsx`](src/game/Player.tsx) |
| retrieval as a query over the forest | lantern query in [`HUD.tsx`](src/game/HUD.tsx) |

The bundled catalog is a snapshot. Chunk counts are **not** produced in the
browser — they come from DocKG (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes WHERE kind='chunk'`
on each book's `graph.sqlite`). Hamlet's 420 is that count. To rebuild the
snapshot after ingest:

```bash
python scripts/export_web_catalog.py
```

Trees are instanced (one wood draw + one leaf draw) so 253 crowns stay
interactive. Attractors, nodes, and leaves are capped for the browser;
raise the caps in `growTree.ts` if you want denser Hamlet-scale skeletons.

## Layout of `src/game`

```
catalog.ts     253 books: genre, chunks, excerpt, tags
growTree.ts    space colonization + pipe-model radii + leaf points
forest.ts      grove layout (crown-aware placement), roads, circuit waypoints, home
corpusTree.ts  the hub redwood: one limb per book, pipe-model trunk, needle sprays
exhibits.ts    roadside glades for set pieces
CorpusRedwood.tsx, Mysterium.tsx   the redwood and the Kepler exhibit
seasons.ts     canopy density + leaf / fog / ground palettes
sim.ts         cart pose, throttle, steer, trunk collision, teleport
Player.tsx     lantern cart + chase camera (A = left from behind)
Trees.tsx      InstancedMesh wood cylinders + icosahedron leaves
World.tsx      ground, roads, lantern trail, fog, plinth
HUD.tsx        plaque, minimap jump, atlas, lantern query, press
```

To grow from the real corpus instead of the bundled catalog, replace
`catalog.ts` with JSON from the ingestion pipeline (id, title, author,
genre, chunk count, excerpt, tags). `forest.ts` already sizes a tree from
`chunks` and leans it with `GENRE_TROPISM`.
